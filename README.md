Introduction:


Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of machine learning frameworks designed by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in 2014. GANs consist of two neural networks, the generator and the discriminator, which compete against each other to create data that is indistinguishable from real data. This repository provides practical examples and assignments to help you understand and apply GANs and related techniques using Python and popular libraries such as TensorFlow or Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.


Assignments Overview:


Assignment 1: Word2Vec Implementation
Description: This assignment focuses on implementing Word2Vec, a technique for learning vector representations of words in a text corpus. You will explore how to train Word2Vec models and evaluate their performance on various tasks.

Assignment 2: Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
Description: In this assignment, you will implement a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), a type of generative model that learns to compress and reconstruct data. The assignment includes training the VAE on a dataset and evaluating its reconstruction quality.

Assignment 3: Autoencoder
Description: This assignment involves implementing an Autoencoder, a type of neural network that learns to compress and reconstruct data. You will train the Autoencoder on a sample dataset and experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters to improve its performance.
